# Future Design

Hi, this is Lean's page.

# Future Design Potential

Given the feedback received during the design process, there is room for further optimization, especially in regards to organizations interconnecting with the user. Some of the major points in the current design include the optimization of the UI in the home page to be more familiar to the user as well as reducing the size of the filtering sidebars to not be more prominent in these pages. The current design may not immediately spark interest in the user's ability at first, as the home page is the most essential page in the design process, and the first page the user gets to typically.
A number of other design potentials were noted, but the most important was of connecting organizations with the user, in ways such as organizational linkups where organizations can sign up to connect with volunteers through the website instead of at location or through their website although some organizations prefer their own websites for further interaction. The hub is intended as a stepping stone for volunteers to look and track their opportunities wherever possible. Another note is that organizations can directly provide feedback in terms of how easy it is to track trustable volunteers, to how users can manage their time, and planning. The current design does well in fulfilling many of its objectives, but the overall design can still be further optimized to ensure as much engagement between users and organizations.

# What Designers Should and Should Not Do
It is critical that designers not only focus on what information is put on their websites or applications, but the very aesthetics of them. Designers should pay especially close attention to the location and size of information, where users can directly perceive what stands out to them when they visit the page. It forms half of what we call, the "Balance of Detail," where information is measured against both its location, size, and context to provide the right amount for users to read and interpret. A right balance of detail means that there is not too much information and is placed in easily seeable areas of the application.
Another critical part of the balance of detail is the emphasis of functional location. The most essential functions of an application must be easily accessable and not take many clicks or taps to get to. In this way, users will not get lost in navigating the application to perform certain actions. Pictures are also included in the emphasis, as what the picture is and other parameters, like location and size, can enhance the readability of the application. They can help convey information that text cannot do without cluttering a region. 

Designers should be careful in the balance of detail; they should not put too much information to clutter, or put too little into it as to convey little of what is necessary. Other areas to note are the UI and color aesthetics; for the UI, it should not be confusing and guide the user to the most essential parts. Bad UI in this case would mean that information is conveyed right but is placed at locations that require users to move around. In terms of color, the application should not use too many colors that blend in too much, for example a red background with green text is not a good design contrast in comparison to white and black. This is measured as a "Contrast Ratio" where the higher the contrast, the more readable it is. The contrast ratio definition is the measure of brightness of the the backgound to the text, which ever is brighter. The contrast plays a very important role in website design where users can easily recognize and see the text visually. In future web design, designers should note both information amount and visual aesthetic in how users can easily recognize elements of an application or page.
