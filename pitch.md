# Pitch

Now, more than ever, communities around the globe are in need of help. With the world news cycle of negative developments on so many fronts seemingly impossible to avoid, it can be incredibly easy for people to lose hope and feel like there is nothing they can do to change the state of the world. We at VolunteerHub have felt this before, and we want to help others get out of this situation. We have designed a platform that connects users wanting to affect change in their communities with organizations in their area that are in need of help. Our goal is to be as frictionless as possible for all parties involved while encouraging people to participate as much as possible. We hope you enjoy using VolunteerHub!
