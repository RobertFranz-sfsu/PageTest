# Prototyping

Once our wireframes were built out, we began the 
dual processes of
1. iterating upon our initial design for the main pages 
illustrated previously, and
2. further fleshing out the gaps in our website by 
filling in the wireframes with actual UI prototypes 
and building out the connecitive tissue that every website 
needs to be practically navigable.

To ground our iteration choices in something beyond just 
our own whims, we utilized two main strategies for 
understanding what would actually improve the site:
1. Heuristic Evaluation of Issues
2. Usability Testing

### Heuristic Evaluation of Issues
This technique had our team identify 
problems and categorize them into specific heuristics used 
in HCI research and rank how severe each issue was.

### Usability Testing
This technique had our team develop tasks we would like 
our users to be able to intuitively perform, thus helping 
to achieve our goal of minimal friction in design. Upon 
giving the list of tasks to our users, we then watched how 
our users actually performed the tasks, noting whether they 
were able to successfully complete them, and 
identifying
if they performed the tasks in the way we anticipated or in 
some novel way we had not previously expected. Combined 
with a post-use survey, this data helped us further refine.
