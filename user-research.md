# User Research

## Methods Used

The two methods we selected for user research are focus groups and one-on-one interviews.The reason we chose to go with these methods is we believed that
the design of the final app should be motivated by the users that will ultimately end up using the application. Considering the perspectives of the target
audience will allow our team to create an application better suited for the users.

## Analysis of Data
The data that was obtained was purely qualitative. We observed that the best way to analyze the data was to perform affinity mapping on it. The thematic
analysis approach that we took was a semantic/latent approach. Firstly, we grouped the interviews and focus group for the volunteers into one group and the non-volunteers into another group. We performed a thematic analysis on both groups separately. 

The first round of the thematic analysis was done by each member of the team individually. Each member of the team went through the transcribed transcript
and wrote down either word-for-word or paraphrased the sentences or notions that they thought were interesting from the participants. Then, we came
together and put all our sticky notes together and began to interpret patterns. The process of pattern interpretation involved grouping together sticky
notes that seemed to belong in the same group and from each individual group we coded them into themes. We discussed between each other about the
overarching theme that we saw among the sticky notes that stuck together.      


## Findings
### Volunteers

#### Convenience for volunteers should be a priority
After conducting the interviews and analyzing the data gathered, it was clear that convenience was a defining factor whether someone volunteered for an
organization or not and how they enjoyed their experience.  People often have busy schedules so making the process of finding opportunities for volunteers
as convenient as possible helps alleviate wasted time.  Similarly, people were much more likely to volunteer when opportunities were within a relatively
close distance and appeared accessible.  Organizations which were well run and organized throughout the hiring and start up process were more likely to
retain volunteers.  One interviewee stated their “first experience volunteering … was rather chaotic.”  Another proclaimed: “the biggest pain point was
just a lack of knowledge about where to start.”  Multiple interviewees stated that there was almost no onboarding process when they first started.
Improving the signing up and onboarding process would greatly improve the overall experience.
  
#### Ease of Access
Furthering the idea of convenience, we found people were more likely to volunteer when they were not required to go out and search for volunteering
opportunities themselves.  The convenience from having friends who already volunteer or having connections to a volunteering organization led to people
being much more likely to start volunteering.

#### Compulsion in Volunteering
Our interviewees expressed a distaste for compulsory hours volunteered.  Volunteers preferred organizations which provided more flexible work scheduling
over those which required a rigid schedule or had a minimum hours worked requirement.  Potential volunteers should be enticed to volunteer, rather than
made to.
  
#### Incentives for Volunteers
Volunteering, by definition, does not provide monetary compensation for the work done.  Alternative incentives are important to potential volunteers when
deciding whether they should commit their time to an organization.  This incentive could be as simple as providing an opportunity to learn something or
interact with kind and like-minded people.

Additionally, the incentives could be volunteer requirements for school or even peer pressure as one person stated: “my coworkers who did participate in
the events kept talking about how much fun they had, so after a while, I started to get a bit of FOMO.”  This statement was echoed by another: “I’d say
the biggest motivator is peer pressure. That’s what made me start coming to events--I didn’t want to miss out on the social aspect.”

#### Positive Energy and Self-Fulfillment 
Potentially the most influential incentive is the positive energy and sense of self-fulfillment volunteering provides to people.  This can be observed
even more so when someone volunteers for a cause which deeply resonates with them.  Our interviewees reported that once people experience the positive
energy from volunteering, they are intrinsically motivated to participate more in the future.  Furthermore, if people are able to observe the benefits,
they are more likely to be interested in volunteering for the first time.

### Non-Volunteers
#### Knowing Volunteers Creates Volunteers
Similar to what the volunteer interviewees stated, the non-volunteers stated that having friends or family would or does in fact instill an interest in
volunteering.  Having friends or family who volunteer allows for a person to see first hand the type of positive energy someone receives when they
volunteer.  Additionally, knowing someone who volunteers comes back to the notion of making the process of connecting with an organization as convenient
as possible for potential volunteers.  
  
#### Incentives
One major reason for why they do not volunteer was the lack of incentive to.  For someone who does not volunteer, they may have not experienced the sense
of self-fulfillment from volunteering or simply do not believe it is enough to compensate for their time.  One interviewee described volunteering as “work
without the money” which captures how many view volunteering.  People need money in order to survive and only have so much time.  Workers only have so
much free time and it is understandable if they value enjoying it another way rather than volunteering.

	
In order to alleviate these issues, we would need to address ways on how to demonstrate the non-monetary incentives of volunteering and making the process
as convenient as possible in order to show we value the volunteer’s time.

#### Put Volunteers First
Volunteers should be put first in order to entice people to sign up.  Ultimately this means to make things as easy, quick, and convenient as possible for
potential volunteers.  Organizations should not have too many constraints for people who are looking into volunteering for them.  Multiple interviewees
stated a frustration with some organizations requiring previous experience and believed training should be offered instead.  Volunteers should also be
able to sign up for more flexible schedules.  One person stated that they “would feel more comfortable volunteering if the organization takes into
consideration the hours I can offer to work.”  If these barriers were reduced or improved upon, one interviewee stated that they would “definitely
volunteer.”

## Discussion or Implications for Design
Through the analysis of our user data, we have identified several design elements that we believe will address some of the biggest priorities both that
our users have explicitly stated they have and that we have observed as motivators of increased volunteer participation.

The biggest priority we heard from our users explicitly was regarding the effective use of time as it related to volunteer work. This is because time is
often an inhibiting factor that affects users’ ability to volunteer. With this in mind, we want to implement several time-saving features that will
maximize a user’s time while using our site: a favorites section for a user to identify their favorite organizations to volunteer for a favorite
organization or a favorite recurring volunteer opportunity, a “Volunteer Again” section for a user to have an express signup flow for a volunteer
opportunity they have done in the past, and allowing the user to set a schedule that they are available to volunteer so that only opportunities that fit
that schedule will be shown to the user. Users will also be able to manually search for opportunities by distance, by time, by category, or by tag in 
order to save them time. We also will incorporate discovery features like showing a prominent “Featured” section on the front page to showcase
organizations or opportunities of note, with both the intention of saving the user time but also as an educational vehicle to introduce users to new causes they may not know to look for.

Another issue our users identified was that the process of volunteering from signup to onboarding is often disorganized and unclear. To address this, we
want to both have the ability for and encourage organizations on the platform to advertise what an opportunity actually entails from onboarding to
continued work. One of our original goals in design was to minimize the need for organizations to input information as we did not want to create an extra
burden of work on them. To address this, we also will implement the ability for volunteer users on the platform to leave comments on posted opportunities
to allow for this knowledge of onboarding and what the actual work looks like to be crowd-sourced. We also want to give users the ability to leave
anonymous and private feedback to an organization after they have volunteered to give an avenue for future improvement of the experience.

We have also discussed features that we hope will encourage people that use our site to engage more frequently in volunteer work. These include gamifying
features like badges for taking certain actions and inspirational features like a view of the number of hours an individual has volunteered and the number
of organizations they have helped. We also want to implement features that leverage the social component of giving back to the community by prominently
featuring sharing buttons on both particular opportunities or the badges / impact pages. This can also serve as a convenient way for schools or other
programs that require a certain number of volunteer hours to verify that work has been done. We also want to feature prominently photos in all
organization and opportunity materials to have users get a glimpse into what the actual impact of volunteering is to encourage engagement.

## Limitations

Despite all our research and design discussion, there are, of course, limitations to this work. These limitations fall in two major categories:
limitations in our design and limitations in our data. We identified the limitations of our design by pulling out some of the primary pain points users
expressed and failing to implement a way to solve for these. These limitations include: providing some sort of monetary incentive to the user for
participation, dealing with the lack of free time some users experience with other obligations they face, and fundamentally getting users to believe in
causes and get intrinsically excited about giving back to their community. We have attempted to indirectly affect each of these areas as they are
difficult problems to very fundamentally tackle through a technological solution instead of a community-based one. The limitations in our data were that 
our sample size is comparatively quite low given the time constraints for collection we had, the focus group participants were primarily from a specific
population (CS students at SF State) that didn’t exactly match with our target audience for the application, and the population of designers (our team) 
that participated in affinity diagramming was relatively small so the interpretations of the data may have not been as diverse compared to a broader sample of people participating in that process.
