# Prototyping

## Heuristic Evaluation of Issues in Prototypes 

### Problem 1
Problem: It is difficult to access different parts of the website quickly from the homepage. There is no main menu to navigate the website quickly.

Severity: 2 - Minor 

Heuristics: #3 - User in Control, #6 - Recognition over recall

Recommendation: Add a navigation menu to the top of every page, so that users are able to navigate throughout the website freely.

### Problem 2
Problem: Prototype does not show what happens when we click volunteer. Once the user clicks ‘Volunteer’ where is the user directed to? How do they actually apply for a position, if they need to.

Severity: 4 - Critical 

Heuristics: #2 - Match between system and real world, #3 - User control and freedom

Recommendation: Make it more clear as to what will happen when the user clicks ‘Volunteer’. This can be done by creating another page that will direct the user to schedule their opportunity.

### Problem 3
Problem: Buttons on all the UI pages seem very small.

Severity: 2 - Minor Usability Problem

Heuristics: #4 - Consistency and Standards

Recommendation: Make these buttons bigger and more visible. The words in the middle of the button are also not visible. This needs to be fixed as well.

### Problem 4
Problem: The Login page is missing the “Login” Title on top. Also, it doesn’t have a sign-up button near the top right next to the Home button. This makes it difficult for the user to sign up if they need to register.

### Problem 6
Problem: The schedule page is supposed to show events or schedule a new event. However, from the page it is unclear as to what the user should do afterwards. It is also unclear as to how the user should make new events.
